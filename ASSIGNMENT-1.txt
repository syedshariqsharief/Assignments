1Q) Define Artifical Intelligence and provide examples of its applications.

Ans) Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI involves the development of algorithms that enables     computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception,speech recognition,decision making and language translation.
Examples of AI applications include:
1. vistual personal Assistants
2. Recommendation systems
3. Autonomous vehicles
4. Gaming
5. Healthcare
6. Fraud detection
7. language Translation

3Q) what is python? Discuss its main features and advantages.
Ans) Python is a set of instructions that we give in the form of a Programme to our computer to perform any specific task. It is a Programming language having properties like it is interpreted, object-oriented and it is high-level too. Due to its beginner-friendly syntax, it became a clear choice for beginners to start their programming journey. The major focus behind creating it is making it easier for developers to read and understand, also reducing the lines of code.

1)Easy to read and understand
2)Interpreted language
3)Object-oriented programming language
4)Free and open-source
5)Versatile and Extensible
6)Multi-platform
7)Hundreds of libraries and frameworks
8)Flexible, supports GUI

     2) Rich ecosystem of libraries
     3) support for data analysis and visualization
     4) strong community and active development
     5) flexibity and scability
     6) integration capabilities
     7) Availability of pre-trained models and tools 
     8) support for deep learning 
     9) cross platform compatibility
    10) Educational Resources

5Q) Discuss importance of indention in python code.

Ans)Indentation is a very important concept of Python because without properly indenting the Python code, you will end up seeing IndentationError and the code will not get compiled.
    Python indentation refers to adding white space before a statement to a particular block of code. In another word, all the statements with the same space to the right, belong to the   same code block.
  
Example 1
The lines print(‘Logging on to geeksforgeeks…’) and print(‘retype the URL.’) are two separate code blocks. The two blocks of code in our example if-statement are both indented four spaces. The final print(‘All set!’) is not indented, so it does not belong to the else block. 

# Python program showing
# indentation
 
site = 'gfg'
 
if site == 'gfg':
    print('Logging on to geeksforgeeks...')
else:
    print('retype the URL.')
print('All set !')

6Q) Define a variable in python provide example of valid variable names.
Ans)Python Variable is containers that store values. Python is not “statically typed”. We do not need to declare variables before using them or declare their type. A variable is created the moment we first assign a value to it. A Python variable is a name given to a memory location. It is the basic unit of storage in a program. In this article, we will see how to define a variable in Python.
example: # An integer assignment 
age = 45
  
# A floating point 
salary = 1456.8
  
# A string 
name = "John"
  
print(age) 
print(salary) 
print(name) 

7Q) Explain the different between keyword and identifier in python.
Ans) Keywords: Keywords are specific reserved words in C each of which has a specific feature associated with it. Almost all of the words which help us use the functionality of the C language are included in the list of keywords. So you can imagine that the list of keywords is not going to be a small one! There are a total of 32 keywords in C:
ex:import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)

Identifiers: Identifiers are used as the general terminology for naming of variables, functions and arrays. These are user defined names consisting of arbitrarily long sequence of letters and digits with either a letter or the underscore(_) as a first character. Identifier names must differ in spelling and case from any keywords. You cannot use keywords as identifiers; they are reserved for special use. 
EX: my_variable
    count
    employee
    calculate_salary

8Q) List the basic data types available in python.
Ans) In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use for various purposes. they are:
     my_string = "Hello, World!"
Numeric Types:
Integer (int): Used for whole numbers (positive or negative). For example:
my_integer = 42
Float (float): Used for decimal numbers. For example:
my_float = 3.14
Complex (complex): Used for complex numbers (with a real and imaginary part). For example
my_complex = 1 + 2j
List (list): Ordered collection of items (mutable). For example:my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Tuple (tuple): Ordered collection of items (immutable). For example my_tuple = (10, 20, 30)


Text Type (String): Represented by the str type, strings are used to store textual data. For example:
9Q)Describe the syntax for an if statement in python.
Ans) 
In Python, the if statement is used for conditional execution. It allows you to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is met. Here’s the basic syntax for an if statement:
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is true

number = 10
if number > 0:
    print('Number is positive')
print('This statement always executes')

The condition can be any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value (True or False).
If the condition is True, the indented code block below the if statement will be executed

10Q) Elif statement purpose in python.Certainly! In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use for various purposes. Let’s explore them:

Ans) In Python, the elif keyword is used as part of the if statement to check multiple conditions. It stands for "else if," which means "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition." Here's a basic example of how it works:

a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
    print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
    print("a and b are equal")
